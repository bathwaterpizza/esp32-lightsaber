## Description

This project is an ESP32-powered IoT "lightsaber" that uses motion gestures to control smart home devices via MQTT. By recognizing directional swings using a built-in MPU6050 IMU, the device sends specific commands to a server integrated with Home Assistant. You can trigger actions like toggling lights, playing Spotify tracks, or using TTS for weather updatesâ€”all with a flick of the wrist. Users can also record and store custom gesture sequences for new automations. Additional features include onboard LED animations, sound effects via DFPlayer Mini, and real-time debugging through WebSerial.
